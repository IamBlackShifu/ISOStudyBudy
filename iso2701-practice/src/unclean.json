As\u00a0EVEG grew and expanded its operations globally, ensuring the security of its information and systems became crucial. As such, the top management of EVEG decided to implement an information security management system (ISMS) based on ISO/IEC 27001. Following a comprehensive risk assessment, the ISMS team identified the information security controls from Annex A of ISO/IEC 27001 that were critical for the organization\u2019s security posture.\n\nTo safeguard its sensitive data, the ISMS team implemented robust access control systems to ensure that employees have access only to the information that is necessary for their roles. In addition, multi-factor authentication (MFA) was also introduced for privileged accounts, to further reduce the risk of unauthorized access. Furthermore,\u00a0it\u00a0also recognized the importance of segregating conflicting duties and responsibilities within the organization. As part of the security measures, the top management ensured that employees' roles and responsibilities are clearly defined, and conflicting duties are separated to prevent potential abuse or unauthorized access to sensitive information.\n\nThe ISMS team also addressed the need to maintain information security at an appropriate level during disruptions. The ISMS team determined that unforeseen events, such as natural disasters, cyberattacks, or system failures can potentially impact EVEG\u2019s operations and information security. For this reason,\u00a0the ISMS team diligently planned and prepared for such disruptions, ensuring that information security remains robust and effective even in challenging circumstances.\n\nThe ISMS team also determine that it is critical to maintain backup copies of information, software, and systems. As such, it established a comprehensive and topic-specific policy on backup, ensuring that regular backup copies are created and maintained securely. \n\nIn addition to the focus on access controls, multi-factor authentication, and contingency planning,\u00a0the ISMS team prioritized the protection of EVEG\u2019s valuable intellectual property and ensuring the secure use of sensitive information. The team decided to implement controls that define effective rules for the use of cryptographic techniques, including cryptographic key management. Furthermore,\u00a0to protect intellectual property rights, the team implemented appropriate procedures to safeguard their valuable intellectual assets from unauthorized use, replication, or infringement.\u00a0\n\nThe ISMS team\u00a0failed to conduct a thorough cost analysis for the implementation of the controls. Thus, it allocated insufficient resources in certain areas. The team encountered challenges in effectively defining and implementing the rules for cryptographic key management, compromising the security of its sensitive information. The lack of adequate resources and preparation also led to gaps in its backup and recovery procedures.
